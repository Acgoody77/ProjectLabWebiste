After a www.depts.ttu.edu site is created, the website administrator needs to create a default page in the root folder of the account in order for their website address to function.  The default page should be saved as one of the following file names:
index.php
index.asp
index.aspx
index.htm
index.html
default.php
default.asp
default.aspx
default.htm
default.html
home.php
home.asp
home.aspx
home.htm
home.html
Only one of these files is needed.  This file is the page that is displayed when users browse to http://www.depts.ttu.edu/site_name.
The Web server will check for and display the default page in the order listed above.
EXAMPLE: If both an index.php and an index.asp page exist, the index.php page will be displayed when users browse to http://www.depts.ttu.edu/site_name.  This is because index.php is higher in the list than index.asp.
